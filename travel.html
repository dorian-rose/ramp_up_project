          <h2>Mexican Caribbean</h2>
          <p>
            Mexico's Caribbean cost, on the Yucatan peninsula, offers a diverse
            range of experiences. Cancun and, increasingly, Playa del Carmen,
            are cities dedicated almost entirely to tourism, and here you will
            find any number of all inclusive resorts and luxury hotels. Further
            to the south the town of Tulum is also a tourist hot-spot, although
            with a slightly more alternative vibe, and a beautiful beach
            overlooked by Mayan ruins perched atop the cliffs. I decided to skip
            the crowds and stay near Xcalak, a small fishing village near the
            border with Belize. Although there are several comfortable hotels in
            the area, it has not been exploited in the same way as the coast
            further north, and offers a much more authentic experience.
            Snorkelling right off the beach, you can see many types of fish and
            even turtles, or if you are more adventurous you can take a trip
            with the local dive shop to the famous Chinchorro bank dive site.

          <h2>Sayulita</h2>
          <p>
            Sayulita is a town on Mexico's Pacific coast in the state of
            Nayarit. Although not far from the famous tourist destination Puerto
            Vallarta, Sayulita is a more relaxed, authentic option. While still
            a popular tourist destination offering comfortable tourist
            amenities, Sayulita still manages to retains a quaint beach village
            vibe. Sayuliat town has two beach options, both beautiful and a
            short walk from the centre of town: Playa Central has larger surf
            while Playa de los Muertos has more sheltered water. However, my
            advice is to hire a bike from the local bike shop and take a half
            hour ride through the forest - you will end up at a rugged, palm
            lined beach which you will have entirely to yourself.

          <h2>Bacalar and the Cenotes</h2>
          <p>
            Although not technically beaches, while you are searching for water
            and sun in the Yucatan Peninsula you cannot miss Lake Bacalar and
            the cenotes. <br />
            Bacalar is a freshwater lake located near the border with Belize in
            the Yucatan Peninsula, known as the 'lake of seven colours' for its
            varyied and striking shades of blue. You can swim in its cristaline
            blue waters and enjoy a sunsoakd, ceviche-eating day on its shores,
            or take a boat trip to appreciate its curious changes in colour. In
            the area you can also visit a colonial fort built by the Spanish as
            protection against pirates, visit Mayan cultural sites or the local
            cenotes.<br />
            The cenotes, which can be found throughout the Yucatan, are
            sandstone sinkholes filled with cristaline freshwater. The cenotes
            were a key source of freshwater for the Mayans, who also believed
            that they were an access to the underworld. Diving in the cristaline
            cenotes is a highly recommended experience
          </p>
