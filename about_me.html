          <p>
            Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a sovereign
            country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the
            island of Tasmania, and numerous smaller islands.[13] With an area
            of 7,617,930 square kilometres (2,941,300 sq mi),[14] Australia is
            the largest country by area in Oceania and the world's sixth-largest
            country. Australia is the oldest,[15] flattest,[16] and driest
            inhabited continent,[17][18] with the least fertile soils.[19][20]
            It is a megadiverse country, and its size gives it a wide variety of
            landscapes and climates, with deserts in the centre, tropical
            rainforests in the north-east, and mountain ranges in the
            south-east.
