            <h2>About Myself</h2>
            <p>
              Hello! I'm Dorian, and it is truly wonderful to have you here.
              Born and raised in Australia to New Zealander and South African
              parents, it was always my dream to travel to as many corners of
              the world as I could. As a child, I made some international trips
              with my family, but it was really during my first independent trip
              to India as an eighteen year old that I knew this was something I
              would repeat at any opportunity presented throughout my life. I
              had been bitten by the travel bug. Throughout my 20s, I travelled
              extensively throughout Latin America, Asia and Oceania. Ever on
              the lookout for new experiences, in 2020 I moved to Spain, where I
              am enjoying getting to know the traditions and cultures of another
              wonderful culture. As things return to normal following the
              pandemic, I am beginning to travel throughout Europe. Stay tuned
              to hear about my adventures here!

            <h2>About This Blog</h2>
            <p>
              As an undergraduate student, I was given the opportunity to spend
              a semester studying in Quer√©taro, Mexico, and during my time there
              fell wholeheartedly in love with the country. I was enchanted by
              the warm people who unreservedly welcomed me into their lives
              there and the lively culture that they invited me to be a part of.
              At weekends, I took any opportunity make trips to neighbouring
              sites and cities, and during holidays, to explore further afield,
              and was in awe of the quaint towns, colourful cities and
              spectacular . In the two months before a global pandemic
              completely closed my country in 2020, I was fortunate enough to be
              able to return to Mexico. I returned to some familiar sites, spent
              time with some familiar faces, and also explored more of this
              incredible country, reaching some off the beaten track sites.
              <br />With this blog, I hope to inspire others to visit Mexico. As
              a country with a reputation for insecurity, I hope to share my
              experience of Mexico as a country that is comfortable to travel,
              that has a rich culture and history, vibrant festivas and
              thousands of places to visit.

            <h2>About My Travels</h2>
            <p>
              Both my parents spent several years backpacking through Asia and
              Europe before settling in Australia, and I grew up on stories of
              their adventures and misadventures during their travels. This
              instilled in me from a young age a desire to travel broadly as an
              adult. From my first independent trip to India in 2010, I
              travelled as frequently as a university schedule (and budget!)
              would allow, exploring the lesser travelled islands of Indonesia
              and Thailand and backpacking Vietnam by bus and bike. <br />
              After a trip with friends through Argentina, Peru, Bolivia and
              Chile, I was inspired to begin learning the Spanish language,
              ultimately leading to my formative experience in a Mexican
              university. Later, I spent 10 months exploring Brazil, Colombia,
              Ecuador and Central America, visiting both popular destination and
              far flung corners. I am currently based in Europe and enjoying
              getting to know this continent!
